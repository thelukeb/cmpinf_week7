# Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

# Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

    - Using welcoming and inclusive language
    - Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
    - Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
    - Focusing on what is best for the community
    - Showing empathy towards other community members
    
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

    - The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
    - Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
    - Public or private harassment
    - Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
    - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
    
# Conflict Resolution
We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the projectâ€™s code of conduct.

If you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.
